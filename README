# README
The file, set_env.sh is only used if you need to re-generate the grammar files.

## If you need to regenerate the grammar files:
- Make sure to setup the environment
        - `source set_env.sh`
- Make the python files.
	- `antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 <GRAMMARFILE>`
- This all assumes that you have antlr4 properly installed.

## File Naming
- Please name your files `new_<filename>.c`.
- The .gitignore file will ignore all things named in this way.
